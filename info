### Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
`In this project, I focused on developing a robust model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
I employed various machine learning techniques, ultimately determining that the Random Forest Classifier was the most effective model for this task.
This model achieved the highest accuracy and precision, successfully distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
The dataset used contained a substantial number of transactions,
and I performed extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.`

### Project 2: Movie Rating Prediction
The objective of this project was to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, cast, and user reviews. After experimenting with several
regression models, I found that the Random Forest Regressor provided the best results. This model excelled in capturing the complex relationships within the data,
leading to highly accurate predictions. The project involved thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation,
ensuring that the Random Forest Regressor was fine-tuned to deliver optimal performance in predicting movie ratings.
